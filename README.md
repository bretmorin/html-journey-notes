# HTML Journey Notes
The goal of this section is to record an HTML and CSS cheat-sheet for a future reference guide so I don't have to rely on a mass amount of bookmarks. 

I'll keep things barebones for my own understanding while providing some reference links if I want to explore other niche areas further.

### Section 1: HTML Basics
1. #### ***Elements***
    - Almost all HTML on a page is pieces of content wrapped in a container
        - Thus almost everything needs an opening and closing tag
        - Using the correct tag with certain elements is important for SEO
        - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element
2. #### ***HTML Page Setup***
    - The homepage should always be named index.html as servers will look for it by default
    - The first line should declare a doctype. In HTML, this would be
    ```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    ```
