# HTML Journey Notes
The goal of this section is to record an HTML and CSS cheat-sheet for a future reference guide so I don't have to rely on a mass amount of bookmarks. 

I'll keep things barebones for my own understanding while providing some reference links if I want to explore other niche areas further.
